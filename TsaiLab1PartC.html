        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 bag of glutinous rice flour (aka mochiko flour or sweet rice flour)</li>
            <li>1 small pumpkin</li>
            <li>Red bean paste</li>
            <li>Cornstarch</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Making the pumkin puree</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, peel and chop up the pumkin into 1-2 inch cubes and remove all seeds.</li>
            <li>Steam, mircowave, or pressure cook the pumpkin until soft. (WARNING if you use a micowave, take it out and check on it every 1-2 minutes because it may or may not blow out the microwave (speaking from personal experience))</li>
            <li>Mash softened pumpkin with a fork or blend until smooth.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Step 2: Making the dough</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the glutinous rice flour in increments to form a playdough-like dough. Add more if dough is still wet or sticky.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Step 3: Shaping the pancakes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Grab a ball of dough a little smaller than the size of your palm. (Use cornstarch on hands to help with sticking)</li>
            <li>Flatten the dough out into a 1/2inch thick disc.</li>
            <li>Make a small indent in the middle of the disc and scoop a spoonful of red bean paste and place it in the middle.</li>
            <li>Fold dough together and close the edges.</li>
            <li>Reflatten into a disc and lightly coat with some cornstarch to prevent sticking.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Step 3: Frying the pancakes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat up some oil or butter in a pan.</li>
            <li>Carefully place the pancakes into the pan.</li>
            <li>Fry until bottom is golden brown and then flip and repeat.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>~Nan gua bing is best served fresh while it's still warm. When they cool they get hard and don't taste as good.~</h3>
        <h2>ENJOY !</h2>
